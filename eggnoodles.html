    <h1 class="h">Homemade Egg Noodles</h1>
    <h1 class="header">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul class="ingredients1">
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, more as needed</li>
        <li class="space">1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li class="space">2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="making1">Steps to Make It</h1>
    <ul class="recipe1">
        <li class="space">Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Combine 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt in a large shallow bowl or on a clean work surface. Make a well in the center, almost like a "bowl" of flour, to hold the eggs. Crack 2 large eggs into it.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Use a fork to beat the eggs and then gradually start incorporating the flour into the eggs. As you beat them, they will slowly but surely take up some flour from the edges.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Keep stirring and pulling in more flour until a solid dough forms. The dough will be sticky. Don't worry; you'll be working in more flour in a moment. Add too much flour now, and the extra flour needed to roll out the noodles will lead to a dry rather than tender noodle.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. With well-floured hands, knead the dough, incorporating more flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to either the work surface or your hands until the dough is smooth and firm and no longer sticky. This takes roughly 5 to 10 minutes. Alternatively, use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and chill it for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Divide the chilled dough into 2 pieces and work with one half of the dough at a time.</li>
        <li class="space padding">On a well-floured surface, roll out the dough to the desired thickness (anywhere from 1/4 inch to paper-thin, depending on your preference). Be sure to rotate or otherwise move the dough between each pass of the rolling pin to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface underneath. Sprinkle everything with flour—including the work surface when you lift the dough—as necessary to keep the dough from sticking.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Use a sharp knife or pizza cutting wheel to cut the noodles. You can make them as narrow or wide as you like. Be sure to cut them as evenly as possible to ensure a uniform cooking time. If you fold the dough to cut, make sure it is floured so it does not stick together.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Lay the noodles on a cooling or drying rack and let them sit until ready to cook. Repeat rolling and cutting with the remaining half of the dough.</li>
        <li class="space padding">To cook, boil the noodles in well-salted water until tender to the bite (2 to 10 minutes for fresh noodles, depending on the thickness). Drain and use in your favorite recipe. Enjoy!</li>
