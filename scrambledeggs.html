    <h1 class="header">Ingredients</h1>
    <ul class="ingredients1">
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li class="space">1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li class="space">Salt, to taste</li>
        <li class="space">Freshly ground white or black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li class="space">2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="making1">Steps to Make It</h1>
    <ul class="recipe1">
        <li class="space">Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Crack 8 large eggs into a glass mixing bowl and beat them until they turn a pale yellow color and you see a lot of bubbles on the surface.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Add 1/2 cup whole milk to the eggs and season to taste with salt and white pepper (or black pepper). Whisk the eggs like crazy. If you're not up for that, you can use an electric beater or stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Whatever device you use, you're trying to beat as much air as possible into the eggs.Note that it may be easier and quicker to beat the eggs in two batches (4 at a time) to make sure you don't have any lumps.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Heat a nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add 2 tablespoons unsalted butter and let it melt.</li>
        <li class="space padding">When the butter in the pan is hot enough to make a drop of water hiss, pour in the eggs. Don't stir. Let the eggs cook for up to a minute or until the bottom starts to set but doesn't brown.</li>
        <li class="space padding">With a heat-resistant spatula, gently push one edge of the egg into the center while tilting the pan to allow the still liquid egg to flow in underneath. Repeat with the other edges, until the eggs are almost entirely set but still look a little wet. (Cook a little further if you prefer dry eggs.)</li>
        <li class="space padding">Turn off the heat and continue gently stirring and turning the egg until all the uncooked parts become firm. Don't break up the egg, keeping the curds as large as possible. If you're adding any cheese, add it now.</li>
        <li class="space padding">Transfer to a plate when the eggs are set but still moist and soft. Eggs are delicate, so they'll continue to cook for a few moments after they're on the plate. Serve immediately and enjoy.</li>
    </ul>
